# Installing Mage Engine

Installing the Engine is as simple as running the following npm command:

```bash
npm install --save mage-engine@latest
```

This will install mage-engine v2.0.3. You should be able to see something like this in your `package.json` under the `dependencies` section:

```json
"libraryA": "0.0.1",
"anotherLibrary": "1.11.1",
"inferno": "7.3.2",
"mage-engine": "2.0.3",
```

This is everything you need to do in order to start. Check the next step on how to set up your project before creating your first scene.
