# Installation

Installing the Engine is as simple as running the following npm command:

```bash
npm install --save mage-engine@latest
```

This will install mage-engine `v3.20.1` . You should be able to see something like this in your `package.json` under the `dependencies` section:

```json
"libraryA": "0.0.1",
"anotherLibrary": "1.11.1",
"inferno": "7.3.2",
"mage-engine": "3.20.1",
```

?> Have a look at the [changelog](/engine/changelog.md) if you want to have a look at what happened.

This is everything you need to do in order to start. Check the next step on how to set up your project before creating your first level.
