# Camera

Accessing the camera and controlling its behaviour is really easy. The Camera is accessibile through the `Scene` module from `mage-engine`.

You can get it by doing this:

```js
import { Scene } from 'mage-engine';
```

Now you can access the camera whenever you want inside your scene, so let's try to change its position to something a bit more convenient.

```js
...
onCreate() {
    const size = 10;
    const color = 0x00ff00;
    const cube = new Cube(size, color);

    cube.setWireframe(true);
    cube.setPosition({ x: 0, y: 0, z: 0});

    const camera = Scene.getCamera();

    camera.setPosition({ z: 15, y: 7 });
    camera.lookAt({ x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 });
}
```

- `Scene.getCamera()` will return the Camera object for this scene, you can now use it to change its position or it's direction.
- `camera.setPosition` allows you to change its position. In this example, we're using `{ y: 7, z: 15 }`. You don't need to specity each coordinate, Mage will default the missing value to the current value of the Camera.
- `camera.lookAt` will set the target of the Camera. In this case, we're explicitly telling the camera to look at the origin `{x: 0, y: 0, z:0 }`. If we wanted to make the camera look at the cube, we coould have done something like this:

```js
camera.lookAt(cube.getPosition());
```

?> Fore more in depth explanation of the Camera object, please refer to the API section. [Camera](/api/camera.md)

If everything went smoothly, you should have something like this:

Let's be honest, a wireframe cube in the middle of the screen is not exactly the most exciting thing ever, right? How about we take it for a spin with a [Script](/getting-started/scripts.md)?
