# The End?

Let's have a quick recap! We spoke about a variety of topics:

## Creating your first level

We created the first level, configured the `Router` to handle it and we learnt how to start the application [here](/engine/getting-started/creating-first-level.md).

?> Level documentation [here](/engine/advanced/core/level.md).

?> Router documentation [here](/engine/advanced/router.md)

## Adding elements to the Scene

We then explored the way of adding elements to the scene (in this demo, just a simple cube) [here](/engine/getting-started/hello-cube.md). We also explored how to control the Camera position and behaviour in the scene.

?> Element documentation is [here](/engine/advanced/core/element.md).

## Adding behaviour to your elements with Scripts.

We created the first simple script for our test cube, settings its rotation over time [here](/engine/getting-started/scripts.md).

?> Scripts documentation is [here](/engine/advanced/scripting/scripts.md).

## Handing user input (keyboard and mouse) via level or script.

Handlng user input is fundamental. The topic is very big and is covere in its separate pages. In this step we simply figured out how to move our simple cube on script based on which key was pressed. All of that happened [here](/engine/getting-starte/handling-input.md).

?> Keyboard input documentation is [here](/engine/advanced/input/keyboard.md)

?> Mouse input documentation is [here](/engine/advanced/input/mouse.md)

?> Gamepad input documentation is [here](/engine/advanced/input/gamepad.md)

## Applying textures and using lights.

We then downloaded some example textures [here](/engine/getting-started/applying-textures.md), and started working with lights, as well as introducing a simple skybox to the scene [here](/engine/getting-started/lights_and_skybox.md).

## Physics and Models

Since things were a bit too easy, we started using Physics! We loaded models in, and we configured the Physics module to work with our scene [here](/engine/getting-started/physics.md).

## User Interface

Last but not least, we saw how to integrate a user interface in the application [here](/engine/getting-started/ui.md). We didn't cover state management or more advanced features, which are explained in their dedicated page.

?> UI documentation is [here](/engine/advanced/ui.md).

?> State management is [here](/engine/advanced/state_management.md).
