# State Management

Mage uses [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) to handle its internal state. Redux is a powerful tool to handle the state of your application, and it can be easily integrated with your UI. The purpose of this documentation is not to explain how Redux works, but to explain how you can use it within your application.
