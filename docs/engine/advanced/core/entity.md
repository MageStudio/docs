Entity is the base class for most components in Mage engine.

?> The Entity class extends the EventDispatcher class from three.js. Please refer to the documentation down below.

##Â Methods

#### constructor({ serializable = true, tag = '', tags = [] })

The entity constructor is responsible for setting base properties for the component.

- `serializable` will determine whether this entity can be converted to JSON.
- `tag` / `tags`: each Entity can be tagged. You can use `tags` to filter out certain entities.

?> By default, each new Entity will come to life with the `all` tag.

#### isSerializable(): boolean

This will return `true` or `false` depending on if the entity is serializable or not.
