# Changelog

## minor: `v3.19.0` **Latest**

Added Labels to the engine. The following has been added:
- `LabelComponent`: When creating a Label, make your Inferno component extend the `LabelComponent` class, as it has the required instructions for the engine.
- `html-to-image`: This library is being used to export Inferno components to images.
