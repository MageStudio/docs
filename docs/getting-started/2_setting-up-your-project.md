# Setting up your project

## index.html

First things first, you will need to setup a `index.html` page somewhere in your project folder. The page should look like something like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/dist/bundle.css">
        <script type="text/javascript" src="/dist/bundle.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class='loader'/>
        <div id="ui"/>
        <div id="gameContainer"/>
    </body>
</html>
```

The structure of the page is completely up to you, but two elements are required:

- `<div id='ui'/>` is the ui container. This is where your UI will render. An entire section of this docs is related to how to enable and work with your UI.
- `<div id='gameContainer'/>` is the game container. Your scenes will be rendered inside this element. The id of this element can be changed to whatever suits your needs.

Both elements can be styled freely.

## index.js

> This documentation is not going to provide help on how to bundle up your application or your stylesheets. Feel free to use whatever bundling tool you prefer.

You project needs an entry point, which we will call `index.js` . It needs to look like this:

```js
import { Router }Â from 'mage-engine';
import Scene from './first/Scene';

const assets = {};
const config = {};

window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    Router.on('/', Scene);
    Router.start(config, assets, '#gameContainer');
});
```

Explanation:

Mage is using an internal Router to bind Scenes to url fragments.

You can import Router by doing `import { Router } from 'mage-engine'` . As you can see in this example, we're using the `load` event on the window object to configure Router and start our application.

- `Router.on('/', Scene)` : this line is performing the binding between the base route and your Scene. This means that when the user will navigate to `http://whereveryourapp.is` , the `Scene` will be executed.
- `Router.start(config, assets, '#gameContainer')` : this is what starts the application. This method requires three parameters: config, assets, and the id of the DOM element where your scenes will be rendered.

The last thing is the scene import line: `import Scene from './first/Scene';`.

This line is obviously just importing the Scene from where you defined it. There are no constraints on how you name your scenes or where you define them.
